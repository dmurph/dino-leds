# Dino LEDs

To use this project, download Processing, and go to Tools -> Add Tools -> Libraries, and search PixelPusher. Restart. Then you should be able to open this project & run it.

Note - sometimes processing has exceptions when you run in from the IDE and you're pushing pixels (only if you're pushing Pixels). Exporting the project to an application and running it that way seems to solve this problem.
